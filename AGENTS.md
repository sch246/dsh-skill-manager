## Intent-package entry

Maintain an executable installation and maintenance map as user understanding, upstream software and environments change. The first map can be incomplete; use user feedback and checked reality to improve it, rather than making accumulated implementation debt the permanent design.

- Start with [this package's STATE](.intent/state/STATE.md) and the user's request. STATE tells an unfamiliar Agent which effects to provide, why they matter, where to find resources, and how to install, adapt, verify and remove them under applicable conditions. Keep every supported capability reachable from that map.
- Before writing, distinguish the information's role. STATE owns intended effects and reusable operational guidance. LOG owns selected actual decisions, observations and their reasons; historical implementation gaps, debt inventories and task progress belong there or in a disposable work record. Keep conditions and adaptation steps needed to act in STATE, without turning it into a status table. LOCK retains an exact purpose-bound realization, not permanent requirements. Do not turn this distinction into a mandatory document transaction for each repair.
- Inspect the target and recover relevant existing decisions before inferring new requirements. Code, tests and past installations are evidence about implementations; they do not decide user intent. Optional cooperation does not establish a required dependency. Change STATE when feedback clarifies an effect or experience improves the executable route, not merely because current code differs.
- Act within the user's existing authority. Read selected sources when why, scope or attribution matters; do not replay every LOG. Choose checks that resolve a real uncertainty at reasonable cost, and distinguish observed results from unperformed checks.
- This entry routes attention; it does not replace STATE or the selected protocol. Follow the package's state record for protocol/binding changes. See [meta-intent's map](../meta-intent/state/STATE.md) when maintaining this guidance or when the roles themselves are unclear.

# Agent entry

This repository hosts an embedded intent package and an installable DeepSeek Harness plugin.

- Semantic root: `.intent/`; read `.intent/state/STATE.json` and its selected protocol before changing lifecycle or compatibility behavior.
- Installable package root: `packages/dsh-skill-manager/`.
- The package owns `patches/deepseek-harness.patch`; every intrusive source region carries a nearby `dsh-skill-manager` locator, while the Git-private receipt written by `scripts/setup.sh` is the removal authority.
- Shared generated catalogs are regenerated from current source contributions and are not statically owned by this package.
- Do not restart `dsh-web`, publish, push, or mutate a remote without explicit user authority.
